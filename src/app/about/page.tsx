              <strong>Daily Grid</strong> is a dashboard that allows users to
              explore and visualize daily electricity generation data for the
              United States. This app aims to play a small role in bringing our
              energy systems into focus, helping us understand where our
              electrical power comes from and its impact on the environment.

                Each card displays the percentage of total electricity generated
                on the previous day from the below categories. Note that the
                percentages on these cards won't necessarily add up to exactly
                100% because they are based on total generation, and some
                generation sources (sources categorized as "other") are not
                counted toward any of these categories.

                  electricity produced from the previous day. The category

                While intended for desktop use, the app is fully responsive and
                works well on mobile devices. In order to adapt to smaller
                screens, some charts may be simplified or simply not be
                displayed on mobile. For the best experience, viewing on desktop
                or a tablet is recommended.
